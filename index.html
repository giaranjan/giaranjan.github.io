            <p class="mb-0" style="color: #1e2b32;"><br>I am an AI engineer and economist currently working at Arkvien. I am also a pre-doctoral Research Assistant working with Dr. George Loewenstein at Carnegie Mellon University. In my free time, I volunteer at the AI for Good Foundation developing their Trendscanner Project.<br>
                <br>My research interests is in applying computation and AI to solve problems in economic and natural sciences. I am interested in how the world works, why it works the way it does, and if it is possible to influence/ manipulate/ disrupt the dynamic of these workings.<br>
                <br>On a more personal note, I am  fascinated by things that I donâ€™t understand and the idea of dismantling their inner workings. When I am not working, my hobbies include philosophy, reading, painting and martial arts. I have my own non profit (which is sort of my pride) - it is called Meliora and it is currently assisting rural folk painters in the areas surrounding the India - Nepal - China border.

                    <h2>Background and Past Experiences</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0" style="color: #1e2b32;">Previously I studied Economics at King's College London. Most of my work there was focussed around computation and economics (and a bit of policy). I was a research assistant under David Aikman, Oliver Bush and Alan Taylor working on macroprudential policies and causal impacts of interest rates and credit controls in the era of UK Radcliffe Report. I also used programming to developed codes for the models (how the fuck to even frame this part LOL - everythign i sya sounds too verbose, leaves info out or sounds like i take myself too seriously), including developing a time series model to convey risk assesments by central banking institutions to assess the efficiency and success of macroprudential regimes a decade since 2008.</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="mb-0" style="color: #1e2b32;">Following this, I undertook field research for the United Nations in Tanzania with Federica Margini and Diego Angemi, where I analysed 3 topics in social and economic policy - mobile money transaction in sub-Saharan Africa, urban-rural divide in health outcomes in Tanzania (conducted for Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp) and extractive industry fiscal policies. Additionally, I assisted the BRGM in Indonesia on a pilot implementation in the peatland landscapes of Riau and Central Kalimantan restoring the peatlands destroyed in the asian hazes. 
                    </a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="mb-0" style="color: #1e2b32;">In my final year as an undergraduate, I completed an internship with the UN in DRC under Thomas Maketa Lutete where I designed new economic models to tackle market failure in the DRC cocoa value chain. My work sought to restructure the entire value chain for the commodity in the country (and, by extension, in west Africa).
